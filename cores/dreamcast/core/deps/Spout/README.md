[Spout](https://spout.zeal.co/) is a video frame sharing system for Microsoft Windows, which allows applications to share OpenGL textures in a similar way to [Syphon](https://github.com/Syphon) for the Mac.

Beta branch is where changes are accumulated and are available for public use. Accumulated changes are transferred to the master branch when testing is completed and no issues are reported. Always submit pull requests to the beta branch so that the changes do not get out of sync. 

A [Spout release](https://github.com/leadedge/Spout2/releases), including a Settings program and demo programs can be downloaded. SpoutSettings should be run at least once to establish registry settings.

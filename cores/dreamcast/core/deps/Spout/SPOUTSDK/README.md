- [Spout for DirectX - DirectX support classes](https://spoutdx-site.netlify.app/)


- [SpoutGL](https://spoutgl-site.netlify.app/)

Contains the Spout SDK source files and a Visual Studio project to build the SDK as a dll.\
The project can also be generated by CMake. See "Building the libraries.pdf" in the root folder.\
Pre-built binaries can be found in the BUILD/Binaries folder.\
Well commented Sender and Receiver OpenGL examples built with OpenFrameworks are the first place to look.

- [SpoutLibrary](https://spoutlibrary-site.netlify.app/)

The Spout SDK as a C-compatible dll that can be used with compilers other than Visual Studio.

- [SpoutDirectX](https://spoutdx-site.netlify.app/)

A sub-set of the Spout SDK for applications using DirectX rather than OpenGL.\
SpoutDX is a support class for that provides functions similar to those in the OpenGL version of the SDK.\
Several examples show details of use.\
SpoutDX was originally designed for D3D11 and has been extended for D3D12 and D3D9. These contain very similar methods, but have not been tested in practical applications and should be considered as developmental.

- ARM build

The Spout library can be built for [Windows on ARM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/overview) for devices powered by Arm processors using DirectX 11, DirectX 12 and OpenGL, if the CMake "SPOUT_BUILD_ARM" option is selected. For x86 processors, the option has no effect and does not need to be selected.\
[sse2neon.h](https://github.com/DLTcollab/sse2neon) is a C/C++ header file that translates Intel SSE intrinsics to [Arm NEON](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/Neon) and is downloaded by CMake. The MIT licence for sse2neon.h is compatible with the Spout BSD licence, subject to the requirements outlined in the file source.\
Note that Spout is designed for Windows and will not operate with Linux.\
ARM build has been tested with Visual Studio and no support can not be offered for other compilers.
